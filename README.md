# Namada Ecosystem -- Community Run Resources

This repo contains a directory of community run Namada resources -- rpcs, indexers, interfaces, monitoring tools, and more!

You can view the directory in json format inside the `user-and-dev-tools` directory, or you can check out the infrastructure section on the Namada community website: [https://namada.community/](https://namada.community/).

## Getting your tool listed
If you're operating some Namada-related infra or have another resource you'd like to make available in this directory, please follow these steps:
1. Fork this repo, and make sure it's current with the latest changes by clicking the 'Sync Fork' button in GitHub (inside your fork).
2. Add your tool(s) by editing the appropriate json file(s) in your fork, inside the `user-and-dev-tools` directory. If your tool is for mainnet, please add it to the the `mainnet` directory, and if your tool is for the
`housefire-alpaca` testnet, please add it to the `testnet` directory.   
3. Once you've added your tools to the json file(s), make a PR to this repo.  

That's it! If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out in the #housefire-canary-net or #mainnet-coordination channels in the Namada Discord server.
